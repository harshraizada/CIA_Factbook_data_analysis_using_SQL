## CIA World Fact book Exploratory Data Analysis in SQL
### link to website is https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/
In this mini project I am trying to explore the CIA dataset file "factbook.db" with SQL.
The fact book contains demographic information like:
`population` - The population as of 2015.
`population_growth` - The annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
`area` - The total land and water area.
